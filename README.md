# IP-Cam Viewer for 3DS/2DS

## Description
IP-Cam Viewer for 3DS/2DS. Displays live video from Android devices running **IP Webcam** or **IP Webcam Pro**. Originally created as a Proof-of-Concept, now in active development as a Beta release. Future updates may come over the next months, although the current version is already highly functional.

## Requirements
- 3DS or 2DS
- Android device with IP Webcam or IP Webcam Pro installed
- Network access (Wi-Fi)
- Recommended host-app resolution: **320×240** for smooth performance. Upper screen (400×240) will display the same 320×240 image.

1. Download the `.3dsx` or `.cia` file from this repository.
2. Launch the Homebrew Launcher or install on your 3DS/2DS.
